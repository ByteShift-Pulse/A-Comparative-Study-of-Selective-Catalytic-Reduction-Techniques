# A Comparative Study of Selective Catalytic Reduction Techniques

A Comparative Study of Selective Catalytic Reduction Techniques evaluates SCR and SNCR systems for NOₓ emissions control, analyzing efficiency (SCR: 70–95% vs. SNCR: 30–70%), operational costs, and catalyst durability under varying temperatures and fuel types. The study focuses on optimizing reagent use (ammonia/urea), catalyst materials (e.g., vanadium, zeolites), and compliance with global emission standards like EURO 6 and Tier 4. Findings aim to guide industries in selecting cost-effective, sustainable solutions for long-term environmental regulations.
